This fork is for people experiencing "not allowed" type errors when using the program on Mac OS.
It may occur because the program does not skip disallowed directories - which are being created on Mac OS
automatically. 

Also using sudo did not fix the issues with the program.

I only tested the command-line tool, but it works on my machine.

# Twilight Boxart

**PROJECT IN MAINTENANCE-MODE**

More info below:

> This project has been forked with the goal of porting from old unsupported .NET Core (making it not work on Linux due to outdated OpenSSL support) to currently supported .NET (both on Windows, MacOS and Linux).
>
> No features are planned aside from keeping it working and cleaning some unused code.
>
> Supported OSes are the same as supported by .NET 8.0.

A boxart downloader written in C#. Uses various sources and scan methods to determine the correct boxart.
Written for [TwilightMenu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu) but can be used for other loader UI's with some config changes. ðŸ˜Š
