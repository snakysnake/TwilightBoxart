This fork is for people experiencing "not allowed" type errors when using the program on Mac OS.
It may occur because the program does not skip disallowed directories - which are being created on Mac OS
automatically. 

Also using sudo did not fix the issues with the program.

I only tested the command-line tool, but it works on my machine.
